ClickyThingy
============

ClickyThingy is an open-source physics application for introductory physics courses. 

Specifically, it was written after I took a physics class that used software called VideoPoint, which would instantly force HD videos into low resolution, lag constantly, and crash constantly when when you were working to a homework deadline. In a science classroom, you just need things to work so that you can move on to what you're trying to accomplish. 

This software was created specifically for Physics 211 at Westminster College by a student at Westminster College, but other schools are completely free to use it if they somehow find it. It is not perfect by any means, so I encourage anybody with any experience to help out however he/she can! 

At the time of writing, ClickyThingy only works for Macs, but the plan is to make it cross-platform.
